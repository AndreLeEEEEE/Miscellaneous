Status stages:
Requirements - I'm still gathering information on what has to be done in this project
Modeling - I'm gathering details on how to achieve the end goal
Construction - I'm programming the script
Deployment - The script/work is getting tested to determine its viability, uncover bugs, and "inspire" more requirements
Complete - The project is done, though it may be revisited in the future due to new conditions
Abandoned - Under certain circumstances, the project had to be cancelled and was never followed through

1.
Objective: Track the auto line's conveyor belt movement using Rick's metal detector.
Status: Construction 
Priority: Medium
Current events: Rick has created a metal detector that signals 0, 1, and 3 depending on if the 
belt is moving, still, or in error(?). I have to get pyUSB to work somehow to read the signals.

2. 
Objective: Reformat Ed's excel sheets for simpler transfer to Monday.com.
Status: Abandoned
Priority: None
Current events: People seem to believe that I gave this program to Ed. I haven't.
He doesn't have it because the fall 2020 semester started before I gave it to him.
When I came back, the important project to work on was project 6. I'm sure the 
fabrication, paint, or stockroom team has noticed that Ed (probably) still sends in
his personalized excel sheets, but the lack of communication at Wanco means information
like that doesn't spread. 

3. Objective: Search for active parts in SR03-15 and C00-11. Once inside container history,
determine if the container is inactive.
Status: Deployment
Priority: Low
Current events: I'm waiting for Kevin's input on the resulting excel sheet I sent him.

4. Objective: Take relevant information from the WIR page and put them in an excel sheet.
This should be universal for each line.
Status: Requirements
Priority: Low
Current events: I'm still trying to figure out the WIR results table.

5. Objective: Use one of two methods, PRP or WIR, to pull draw bar information off of Plex
and put it in an excel sheet for Monday.com. The automated importation to Monday.com may be viable.
Status: Deployment
Priority: Low
Current events: There's no telling when covid restrictions will be lifted. This program has to be
demoed to Kit and someone else, but that will probably require me to be there with them to 
ensure the demo goes as expected. With the advent of pyinstaller, maybe I could just send the
exe file and see what happens.

6. Objective: Get the amount of trailers dropped in trailer lines one and two and display them on
a message board. The board should tell the current time and turn red if a line hasn't made a trailer
in a certain time frame. An .ini file is read in with the required parameters.
Status: Deployment
Priority: Medium
Current events: After receiving a new DCU board, I have to run more tests. I cannot do those yet until
the IT department puts in the board behind a NAT router. When the project is ready to roll, I have to
run the .exe through task scheduler on a separate computer on my work station.

7. Objective: Reformat Dan's excel sheets for simpler transfer to Monday.com.
Status: Complete
Priority: None
Current events: After many tweaks to the code after deployment, Dan hasn't requested my help on it.

8. Objective: Combine many of Kevin's excel workbooks and sheets into one sheet.
Status: Complete
Priority: None
Current events: Kevin has his gigasheet and probably won't ask me to do this again for a while

9. Objective: Use wordpress and gravity forms to make a digital employment application to put
on Wanco's website.
Status: Deployment
Priority: Low
Current events: The form has been completed on the development site. I'll leave it up to Alex to do
what he sees fit with it.

10. Objective: Make a program that takes in information about part requests and puts the data on an
Excel sheet for Monday.com for Rick Sr.
Status: Complete
Priority: None
Current events: I have taught him how to use the program and only what he needs for Monday.com.

11. Objective: Upgrade the dev and live sites' PHP and plugins.
Status: Construction
Priority: Low
Current Events: The dev site has been rolled back to PHP 5.6. No one has talked about this since.

12. Objective: Make a page on the Wanco's website that contains troubleshooting information
about Wanco products that customers reach by scanning QR stickers.
Status: Construction
Priority: Low
Current Events: I have made an example page which displays the formatting.

13. Objective: Make a program that generates the SHA256 hash value of files.
Make a second program that compares the SHA256 hash values of those files.
Status: Deployment
Priority: Low
Current Events: I have realized that this project was moot when I discovered that 7-Winzip
came with hashing features. The program isn't needed to generate the SHA256 hash value of
files since 7-Winzip allows users to easily do that with the right-click menu.
