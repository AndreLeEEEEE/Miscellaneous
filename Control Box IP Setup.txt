In the event that there's issues connecting to the web browser version of the message board, make sure that the ethenet cable from the control box
is actually connected to the computer. Also, make sure that the option to have an ethernet connection is enabled.
- If neither aren't the issue, then go to the computer 'Settings' and click on the 'Network and Internet' section. 
- Find the 'Ethernet' section on the list on the left side of the window.
- Look under the 'Related settings' list for 'Change adapter options'
- A new window should've been opened called 'Network Connections'
- Right-click on the ethernet icon and select 'Properties'
- In the list, find 'Internet Protocol Version 4 (TCP/IPv4)' and click the 'Properties' button
- Select the option: 'Use the following IP address' and enter in the control box's IP address

You can find the control box's IP address through this sequence:
- Menus
- Advanced Menu
- Modem/GPS
- IP Address
You only need to enter in the box's IP address into the computer, the 'Subnet Mask' section will fill itself out.
Ignore the 'Gateway' section too.

Confirm that the board's web broswer form is accessible by typing in the IP address in the URL bar.

This is now obsolete as the message board is accessible over the network.
