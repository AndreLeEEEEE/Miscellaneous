pyinstaller
In command prompt, traverse to the location of the python file you want to 
convert and pyinstaller.exe.
Type in:
pyinstaller --onefile -w [python file name]
--onefile means do the process on just the file, without this, pyinstaller would run on the whole directory(?)
-noconsole (or -w) means running the executable won't bring up command prompt unless the program
needs to prints something. The omission of -w means the program will bring up
command prompt even if the program doesn't use it at all.

auto-py-to-exe
Go to the destination and type auto-py-to-exe into the command prompt.
